Swarm Provenance CLI - Sample Data File
========================================

This is a sample file demonstrating the Swarm Provenance Uploader.

When uploaded to Swarm, this file will be:
1. Read and hashed (SHA256)
2. Base64 encoded
3. Wrapped in provenance metadata
4. Stored on the decentralized Swarm network

The resulting Swarm reference hash uniquely identifies this content
and can be used to retrieve and verify the data at any time.

Key features demonstrated:
- Content integrity via SHA256 hashing
- Metadata preservation
- Decentralized storage
- Cryptographic verification
